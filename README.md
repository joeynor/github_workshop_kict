Just a short workshop for students

1. ## What is VCS
- tracked digital assets using the Version Control system.
- adding documentation to your code, rearranging the methods, adding or removing some classes or resources
- Challenges in Code Management
  1. Maintaining multiple copies of the same code files based on changes done on different dates
  2. Track changes and code reusability 
  3. Trace the file's history to find the version of the code which introduced the bug
  4. Maintain back-up of your files 
  5. Comment out blocks of code to disable a functionality without deleting it 
- What is Version Control System?
  1. Who made the change
  2. Why the change was made (references to problems fixed or features added in the change)
  3. Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that help teams manage and track changes in code over time.

- Version Control System is also popularly known as:
  1. Revision Control System
  2. Configuration Management System
  3. Source Control Management System
- Features of VCS
  1. Maintain independent branches of code for team members to track their respective changes
  2. Ease of comparison of code across different branches
  3. Merging of code from several branches of multiple team members
  4. The convenience of tracing changes in code to find the version that introduced a bug
  5. Annotate changes with the name of author and message in a particular version of the code. This helps to easily identify the intent of the change
  6. Simple comparison across versions to help resolve conflicts in code during merging
  7. Revert changes made to the code to any state from its history.
